# ToDoApp

A to-do angular app with filter , drag and drop , and the possibility to persist your created tasks
for 24 hours. Cool, isn't it ?

The number of tasks to be created is unlimited.

This project was generated using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 19.1.7.

# Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) v^18.19.1 or newer

## Development server

After cloning the project, run

```bash
ng install
```

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will
automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

## Running unit tests

To execute unit tests with the [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io) test runner, use the following command:

```bash
ng test
```

Angular CLI does not come with an end-to-end testing framework by default. You can choose one that suits your needs.
